# iCommerce

Welcome to iCommerce, a back-end api that uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database to contain all of your commercial products and their respective categories. These technologies will allow your site to compete with other store fronts and not risk falling behind your competitors.

## More Details

Essentially there are multiple routes set up to provide a GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE for categories of products, the products themselves, and tags that can be associated with products. Each category can have multiple products, and each product can have multiple tags. These routes will pull all relative data associated with what route you go through.
